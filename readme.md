# RoyalMobile | Webstore

##### Technologies
Go | Gorilla Mux

### Scope
##### What it was designed to do
+ Be a back-end for the front-end
+ Be a good test of Golang, as such this focuses on implementing persistence in a way that's fun to test the language with, but you should probably not replicate this

##### What it wasn't designed to do
- Connect to a database
- Any authentication

### Installation Notes
Please feel free to download or clone the repository. This is just the back-end, front-end repositories are named `royalmobile_fe_*`. By default the back-end will run on port `4000` which the front-end repositories expect.

To run:
- From project root
- Run `go run main.go`
